                Why Environmental Awareness is important?
            </h2>
            <p class="content">Environmental awareness means exactly what you may think: an awareness around the natural
                environment and
                the choices that either promote its well-being or cause it more harm. It is also the awareness that the
                earth is in need of protection for its survival. Along with this, the term “environmentalism” is an
                ideology that humans human decisions and help the planet's health take a complete 180 degree in the
                other direction.

                Major Environmental Problems

            <p class="content">
                Some environmental life species require substantial areas to help provide food, living space, and other
                different assets. These creatures are called area specific. At the point when the biome is divided, the
                vast patches of living space don't exist anymore. It becomes more troublesome for the wildlife to get
                the assets they need in order to survive. The environment goes on, even though the animals and plant
                life are not there to help sustain it properly.

                        Rapid population growth puts strain on natural resources, which results in the degradation of
                        our environment. Mortality rate has gone down due to better medical facilities, which has
                        resulted in an increased lifespan. More population simply means more demand for food, clothes
                        and shelter. You need more space to grow food and provide homes to millions of people. This
                        results in deforestation, which is another factor in environmental degradation.

                        Landfills pollute the environment and destroy the beauty of the city. Landfills come within the
                        city due to the large amount of waste that gets generated by households, industries, factories
                        and hospitals. Landfills pose a great risk to the health of the environment and the people who
                        live there. Landfills produce a foul smell when burned and cause substantial environmental
                        degradation.

                        Deforestation
                        Deforestation is the cutting down of trees to make way for more homes and industries. Rapid
                        growth in population and urban sprawl are two of the major causes of deforestation. Apart from
                        that, the use of forest land for agriculture, animal grazing, harvest for fuelwood and logging
                        are some of the other causes of deforestation. Deforestation contributes to global warming as
                        decreased forest size puts carbon back into the environment.
